## Installer

Use `make install` to install all dependencies and configure the environment.

The installer supports Arch Linux and MacOS.

Note that I have not tested the installer too much so it may not work; I don't really care as what really matters to me is that all steps and dependencies of my working environment are recorded somewhere.

## Neovim

I use Neovim as a text editor. I have a [Neovim config](https://github.com/serhez/nvim-conf) which you can also optionally install through the installer (it will ask you).
